### This GitHub repository contains a list of tools, links to pipelines and example chunks of R and HPC code employed in the data chapters in my PhD thesis:

## Genomic insights into the adaptive potential of the hihi (*Notiomystis cincta*), a threatened Aotearoa New Zealand bird



### The thesis is devided into four data chapters:


### Chapter 2: A framework to resolve sample mix-ups

### Chapter 3: A GWAS analysis for hihi adaptive traits

### Chapter 4: A comparison of different data resolutions to estimate inbreeding

### Chapter 5: An inbreeding and inbreeding depression analysis
