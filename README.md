# Genomic insights into the adaptive potential of the hihi (*Notiomystis cincta*), a threatened Aotearoa New Zealand bird

Presented here are a list of tools and example scripts used in each data chapter of my thesis. Within each directory is a brief overview of chapter contents and details about each of the tools used. In recognition of Indigenous Data sovereignty of data related to culturally significant species, any sample IDs have been redacted from these scripts and data files are only available on request.

The thesis is devided into four data chapters:

## Chapter 2: A framework to resolve sample mix-ups

## Chapter 3: A GWAS analysis for hihi adaptive traits

## Chapter 4: A comparison of different data resolutions to estimate inbreeding

## Chapter 5: An inbreeding and inbreeding depression analysis
